I started learning how to coding in January of 2017 after I read a book by Thomas L. Friedman called "Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist's Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations". The book was showing how technology was accelerating change in the world faster than humans could adjust. He used the release of the Iphone in 2007 and social media as examples. Websites like Facebook and Twitter leading to a massive growth of other social media platforms. The smartphone becoming the driving force of accelerating rapid technological change.

He suggested some ways for humans to be able to adapt to this rapidly changing world that we live in. Life learning was the main way to help us to adjust. STEM jobs are in high demand but our country doesn't have enough people to fill the jobs. He used is home state of Minnesota as example of what schools were doing to address the changes in technology. The accelerating changes are important to understand but that is not what inspired me to start learning how to code.

I got interested in learning how to coding because I was struggling to find something to do with my life. I thought about trying to be a writer but that was difficult for me. Friedman, also talked about people who couldn't afford to go to College were teaching themselves how to code. They were getting full-time jobs through apprenticeships at technology companies. I thought I would needed a degree in computer science to have a tech job. The book showed me that it was possible to get a tech job without a degree.

I started doing research on how to learn to code. The book gave me some resources to look into to start learning. At first I was not sure where to start. I kept trying different websites and free courses but wasn't getting any where. Then one day I found out about Quincy Larson who is the creator of [freeCodeCamp.org]. I liked that freeCodeCamp had a curriculum that I could easily follow to get started. Starting with Responsive Web Design with HTML and CSS. Then JavaScript Algorithms and Data structures. Followed by Front-end Libraries. Each certification has projects and challenges to test the skills that you learned. Once you pass everything you move on to the next certification section.

I decided I would work through those three certifications and then do stuff on my own. When I got to my first project I had no issues setting up my HTML code because that's easy. CSS is when my struggles began. Styling my website to make it look nice was so frustrating. I struggled with making the websites responsive as well. I thought I couldn't do it at times but I just told myself do what you can doesn't have to be perfect. I managed to complete all of the projects and move on to JavaScript. In 2018 I started working on JavaScript which quickly got frustrating. Some how I made it through it all with many ups and downs.

Then I started working on a variety of tutorials on YouTube and different websites to build up the skills that I had learned. I was not comfortable or confident enough to do any projects on my own. I attempted to do things on my own but couldn't figure out where to begin. I continued doing tutorials until one day I said that this is not working I need to try doing my own stuff. I tried so many different things it was hard to decide what to do. After a while daily frustration made me decide to quit. Imposter syndrome got the best of me at that point. I made the mistake of not taking mental health breaks when I got frustrated. I let it consume my life everyday and that led to my downfall. I would spend the entire day working on stuff instead of a couple hours. Teaching yourself how to code is very difficult and it's ok to get frustrated. You will feel like an impostor at times but don't give up.
